# release-check.sh: the one command to run before this repo ships anywhere
# public (the public flip, a batch push, a release). It answers two questions
# the per-commit hook cannot answer alone:
#
#   SAFE:     does the whole tracked tree leak anything private?
#   ACCURATE: do the docs still agree with themselves and with the files
#             they point at?
#
# The pre-commit hook checks each commit's additions. This checks everything,
# at once, right before the moment that matters. Run from anywhere in the
# repo: bash scripts/release-check.sh
#
# Checks, in order:
#   1. Leak audit (scripts/leak-audit.sh): denylist terms, emails, home paths.
#   2. Dash scan: no em or en dash anywhere in the tracked tree.
#   3. Prompt sync: the prompt embedded in README.md is byte-identical to
#      prompt.txt. Two copies of the hero prompt that drift is the most
#      embarrassing inaccuracy this repo could ship.
#   4. Dead links: every relative markdown link in every tracked .md file
#      points at a file that exists.
#   5. Feed freshness: feed.xml is not older than the newest post in posts/.
#   6. Feed link shape: every post has an item link at the site's devlog path.
#
# See method/09-safety-nets.md: each gate is a mistake class turned into a
# guard. A green run is not a promise of perfection; it is proof the known
# failure modes were checked mechanically instead of by eye.

# GitHub blob layout. So the artifact was right and its generator was wrong, and
# the next regeneration silently reverted the hand-edit: every item 404'd while
# check 5 called the feed fresh, because freshness compares timestamps and says
# nothing about where a link points.
#
# The root bug is hand-editing a generated file. This check is the backstop that
# notices when the artifact and the decision disagree, whichever one drifted.
# Deliberately offline: a gate that needs the network is a gate that gets
# skipped, and the failure this catches is a wrong URL, not a down server.

# --- 7. Pillar integrity ---------------------------------------------------

# check, not a comment.

# statements, so the gate the devlog post describes never ran. A gate that is
# never executed is a comment. It now runs with the other checks; do not move
# it below the summary block again.

# post shipped with lines like "Honest label on the tin" and a narration adverb
# that no human pass caught. The lint is a machine-local tool; when it is not
# installed the check says so out loud instead of silently passing.

# --- 9. The shape gate still discriminates -----------------------------------
# The pre-commit hook regenerates docs/images/memory-shape.svg and HARD STOPS the
# commit if the generator refuses rather than leaks. That refusal is the only
# thing standing between the private network and a public picture of it, and for
# its whole life it sat below the hook's `exit 0` and never executed once. Same
# bug as check 7's own 2026-07-28 note, in a different file: a gate placed after
# an exit is a comment.
#
# So the guard now has a suite that watches it fail on purpose, and the suite
# runs here. It builds throwaway repos in a temp dir; it never reads the real
# memory network.
